**Quiz**

1.
Question 1
A computer program is said to learn from experience E with

          respect to some task T and some performance measure P if its

          performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

          Suppose we feed a learning algorithm a lot of historical weather

          data, and have it learn to predict weather. In this setting, what is T?

**Explanation**

T = The weather prediction task.
P = The probability of it correctly predicting a future date's weather.
E = The process of the algorithm examining a large amount of historical weather data.

2.
Question 2
Suppose you are working on weather prediction, and your weather

          station makes one of three predictions for each day's weather:

          Sunny, Cloudy or Rainy.  You'd like to use a learning algorithm

          to predict tomorrow's weather.

          Would you treat this as a classification or a regression problem?

**Explanation**

Classification should be used when we are trying to predict a discrete valued output, for example a category type from type1, type2, type3 etc.

3.
Question 3
Suppose you are working on stock market prediction.  You would like to predict whether or not a certain company will win a patent infringement lawsuit (by training on data of companies that had to defend against similar lawsuits).  Would you treat this as a classification or a regression problem?

**Explanation**

Classification should be used when we are trying to predict a discrete valued output, for example a category type from type1, type2, type3 etc.


4.
Question 4
Some of the problems below are best addressed using a supervised

          learning algorithm, and the others with an unsupervised

          learning algorithm.  Which of the following would you apply

          supervised learning to?  (Select all that apply.) In each case, assume some appropriate

          dataset is available for your algorithm to learn from.


Given data on how 1000 medical patients respond to an experimental drug (such as effectiveness of the treatment, side effects, etc.), discover whether there are different categories or "types" of patients in terms of how they respond to the drug, and if so what these categories are.

**Explanation**

Looks like no labels are given to us so it turns out to be an unsupervised learning problem.

Examine a web page, and classify whether the content on the web page should be considered "child friendly" (e.g., non-pornographic, etc.) or "adult."

**Explanation**

This can be addressed via supervised learning, classification, problem, where we can learn from a dataset of web pages that have been labeled as "child friendly" or "adult

In farming, given data on crop yields over the last 50 years, learn to predict next year's crop yields.

**Explanation**

This can be said to be supervised learning problem, where we can learn from historical data (labeled with historical crop yields) to predict future crop yields.

Given a large dataset of medical records from patients suffering from heart disease, try to learn whether there might be different clusters of such patients for which we might tailor separate treatments.

**Explanation**

This can be addressed via unsupervised learning, clustering, algorithm, in which we group patients into different clusters.



5.
Question 5
Which of these is a reasonable definition of machine learning?

**Explanation**

Machine learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
