# Machine_learning_concepts
In this repository, I will try to clear the concepts where I got stuck. I will try my best to throw light on each aspect as precisely as possible. I will try to bring out simplicity in complex terminology and explain it clearly. I totally understand how tough it is when you actually try to learn swimming and what hurdles one faces to be become an expert or maybe learn different strokes as well excluding freestyle. So, keep tuning till the time you overcome some hurdles atleast!


I am also including some of my courses' learnings from different platforms like Coursera, Udemy etc to give a more clear picture for the beginners. Looking forward to help and collaborate!

Thank you.
