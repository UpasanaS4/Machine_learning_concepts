What is a Neural Network finally, I am dying to tell you guys! I learnt it quickly and now its time to care and share.

A neural network is a machine learning modelling technique applied to unstructured data. Now what is this unstructured data?

>> Unstructured data is the data which doesn't have heads or legs (in hindi if you can recall this idiom). If you don't, no worries. It is the data which is incapable 
of being formatted into tables, dataframes i.e. having rows or columns. It could be in the form of audio, video
